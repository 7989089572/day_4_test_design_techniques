# ðŸ“˜ Day 4 â€“ Software Testing Notes

Today I learned and practiced **Test Design Techniques** that help in creating effective test cases:

## 1. Equivalence Partitioning (EP)
- Divides input data into **valid** and **invalid** partitions.
- Reduces test cases while ensuring coverage.
- Example: Password length (6â€“12 characters).

## 2. Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)
- Focuses on testing values **at the boundaries** of input.
- Example: ATM withdrawal range (â‚¹100 â€“ â‚¹10,000).

## 3. Decision Table Testing
- Represents **complex business rules** in a tabular format.
- Example: Online shopping discount rules.

## 4. State Transition Testing
- Validates system behavior when **moving between states**.
- Example: Login system with 3 attempts.

âœ… These techniques improve **test coverage** and reduce redundant test cases.
